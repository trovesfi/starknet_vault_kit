# StarkNet Vault Kit Backend - OSS Version

**This is a reference backend (read-only) for the StarkNet Vault Kit.**

It provides minimal functionality to index vault events and expose basic API endpoints. This OSS version does not include premium features like pricing, automated redeems, SLA monitoring, or advanced analytics.

**For production deployments with full features, see our premium services.**

## What's Included

### Applications

- **`api`** - HTTP API with vault data endpoints
- **`indexer`** - Event indexer for vault reports and redeems
- **`relayerAutomaticRedeem`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **INCOMPLETE** - Automatic redeem processing service
- **`relayerOnChainAum`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **INCOMPLETE** - On-chain AUM management service

### Libraries

- **`@forge/config`** - Configuration management
- **`@forge/db`** - Prisma database client with Prisma schema
- **`@forge/logger`** - Structured logging with Winston
- **`@forge/starknet`** - StarkNet interaction service

## API Endpoints (6 total)

1. `GET /health` - Health check and API info
2. `GET /pending-redeems/:address` - Pending redeems for an address (with limit/offset)
3. `GET /reports/last` - Latest report from database
4. `GET /redeems/:id` - Redeem details by ID
5. `GET /strategy-analytics` - Strategy analytics with APY calculations (with limit/offset)
6. `GET /redeem-required-assets` - Required assets for pending redeems by epoch

## Events Indexed (3 total)

The indexer only tracks these events:

1. **Report** - Vault reports with epoch, supply, and assets
2. **RedeemRequested** - User redeem requests
3. **RedeemClaimed** - Completed redeem claims

## Database Schema (3 models + status)

- `Report`
- `RedeemRequested`
- `RedeemClaimed`
- `IndexerStatus`

## Quick Start with Docker (Development)

1. **Clone and setup:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

2. **Run with Docker Compose (Development Mode):**

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

This starts:

- PostgreSQL database
- API service on port 3000 (with hot reload)
- Indexer service (with hot reload)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Relayer services have Dockerfiles but are not yet functional

3. **Available Services:**
   - API: http://localhost:3000
   - Database: localhost:5432

4. **Check health:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Manual Setup
